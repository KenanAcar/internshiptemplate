Therefore I used data classes on Kotlin and used Mock Data.I opened an Empty Project on Android studio and added 3 files and classes. 	FoodModels.kt (which is under models package)	MainScreen.kt (under ui.theme)	PaymentDialogs.kt (under ui.theme)https://github.com/ewok0116/internshiptemplate/tree/main/projects/Frontend/foodorderingappWhat I need to do in terms of Kotlin?	After DB processes are complete, I need to change the mock data and also on payment selection page only credit card is selected I also need to change that and depending on feedback the successful payment page might stay still instead of automatically leading to selection page.Day-2 I got feedback on fixing and adding some features to the app* Cart button should be bigger* There should be a Dialog that shows products, and they should be deletable or incrementable * There should be toast or toast like structure that appears after adding products to the bar ( I used snackbar)* More payment methods should be added* Navigating back to home page should be manual* The text of payment successful dialog should be fixed* Build variant like theme structure should be made * If wanted, a receipt should appear after the payment I did fix the issues and added the wanted features to the application. Only this one is still in progress* Design patterns should be searched In terms of Build Variant:Build Configuration (build.gradle)flavorDimensions += "company"productFlavors {    create("companyA") {        dimension = "company"        applicationIdSuffix = ".companya"        versionNameSuffix = "-companyA"        manifestPlaceholders["appName"] = "Company A Food"        buildConfigField("String", "COMPANY_THEME", "\"ORANGE\"")    }    create("companyB") {        dimension = "company"        applicationIdSuffix = ".companyb"        versionNameSuffix = "-companyB"        manifestPlaceholders["appName"] = "Company B Food"        buildConfigField("String", "COMPANY_THEME", "\"GREEN\"")    }}Theme Provider (Theme.kt)val LocalAppTheme = compositionLocalOf { ThemeManager.getCurrentTheme() }@Composablefun FoodOrderingAppTheme(content: @Composable () -> Unit) {    val currentTheme = ThemeManager.getCurrentTheme()        CompositionLocalProvider(        LocalAppTheme provides currentTheme    ) {        MaterialTheme(content = content)    }}	Before (Hard-coded colors):@Composablefun ProductCard() {    Card(        colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(            containerColor = Color(0xFFFF8C42) // Hard-coded orange        )    ) { /* content */ }}After (Dynamic colors):@Composablefun ProductCard() {    val theme = LocalAppTheme.current  // Get current theme        Card(        colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(            containerColor = theme.cardColor  // Dynamic color!        )    ) { /* content */ }
